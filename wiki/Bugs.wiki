As of v0.0.1.0:
  # Occasionally gets stuck during the main download loop. Due to:
    # <s>Send() pushing 'l' (now 'd') to the URL bar</s> - fixed v0.0.1.1
    # Possible infinite loop because of quirky directory names
    # <s>Getting stuck in file download due to null response</s> - fixed v0.0.1.2
    # Other Send()'s being sent before the appropriate UI is up. More checks needed to prevent this.
  # <s>"start/resume" and "initialize" shows and hides incorrect</s> - fixed v0.0.1.2
  # Need to find a better way to deal with the message bar in the instances when it reports,
    # "We're sorry, it is taking longer than expected to load information about this image." (somewhat handled)
    # "Oops, we couldn't load information about this image." (this is more problematic)
  # Compatibility bugs, different dialog window names prevent proper activation
  # Dragging the console window occasionally causes the application to quit (originally noticed in v.0.0.1.2.2 ? possibly related to console routines?). <u>'''Note'''</u>: when the application crashes often the CTRL key will be hardlocked into the DOWN position. Meaning if you have a notepad open and you try to write the letter 'f' it will instead send 'CTRL+f'. To resolve this tap the CTRL key several times.
