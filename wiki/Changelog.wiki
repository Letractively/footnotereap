Head = [http://wiki.razing.net/footnotereap/FootnoteReap_v0.0.1.2.3.zip v0.0.1.2.3] (2012-02-18, Hotfix)
  * Fixed: Line 11298 (File "C:\Users\Extreme\Desktop\Footnote\footnote.exe"): Error: Variable used without being declared''
  * Modified launch scripts


[http://wiki.razing.net/footnotereap/FootnoteReap_v0.0.1.2.2.zip v0.0.1.2.2] (2012-02-17, Hotfix)
  * Recompiled the executable as a console application and disabled embedded kernel32.dll calls. The logger is now always enabled. All output should be capturable through STDOUT. The gLoggerEnabled REG_DWORD is now deprecated.
  * Fixed dynamic directory creation. FootnoteReap should now correctly detect "page 1" and "page 1.jpg" in the "Save As" dialog.
  * Added a new emergency exit hotkey (ALT+CTRL+SHIFT+E) and resolved a logic bug that should have prevented the application from ever working.


[http://wiki.razing.net/footnotereap/FootnoteReap_v0.0.1.2.1.zip v0.0.1.2.1] (2011-10-03, Hotfix)
  * Now detects "Save As" and "Select location for download ..." after clicking "Entire Image"


[http://wiki.razing.net/footnotereap/footnote_v0.0.1.2.exe v0.0.1.2] (2011-08-21)
  * GUI fixes (the start/resume and initialize button toggles correctly now; and the 'about' dialog anchors properly to the main window in all cases)
  * improved logging tool / better debug features (to help detect and prevent infinite loops -- see "[http://code.google.com/p/footnotereap/#Tips tips]")
  * fixed several race conditions where the application would get stuck:
    * trying to rediscover the "Entire Image" button,
    * when resolving "Confirm Save As" during a collision, and 
    * an instance where the download would wait indefinitely for the data pump to start when the pipe was inactive 


[http://wiki.razing.net/footnotereap/footnote_v0.0.1.1.exe v0.0.1.1] (2011-08-20)
  * bug fixes (better directory handling and more)
  * using "ALT+D" now instead of "CTRL+L" for greater compatibility


[http://wiki.razing.net/footnotereap/FootnoteReap_v0.0.1.0.zip v0.0.1.0] (2011-08-19)
  * Basic feature set functional (downloading, resuming, recovery cases, automated directory creation, etc)
  * Global hotkeys (F10 - start, F11 - pause)
  * Logging feature set
  * Simple statistics (page and doc counts)
  * Identifies new documents not previously stored in CSV.
