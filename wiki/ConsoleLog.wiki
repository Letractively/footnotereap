==Console Output and Logging Features==

1. *Q:* I downloaded the FootnoteReapDbg.lnk but I couldn't get it to work.  I'm not sure what sort of file it is or how to get it to do anything.  

  <b>A:</b> The FootnoteReapDbg.lnk is the same type of file that exists for all of the shortcuts in the start menu. You can think of it like a one line batch or cmd script. If you ever want to see the command that it's executing. Right click on the lnk file, select properties, and take a look at the target field. In this case it should read:

  `%COMSPEC% /E:ON /V:ON /C cscript ".\scripts\EnableDebugMode.js" && mkdir log & footnote.exe > "log\%DATE:/=-%_%TIME::=.%_footnotereap_log.txt"`

  It's important to make sure the FootnoteReapDbg.lnk file is in the directory with the footnote.exe file. Also there should be a subdirectory in the folder named .\scripts. In the scripts folder should be EnableDebugMode.js.

2. *Q:* I see there is an attached batch file which starts a text log to store the output of the console window (which I can see with the log information), but I cannot cut and paste. How do I do this?

  <b>A:</b> To copy and paste the text out of the console window right click in the title bar and then click "Edit → Mark"

  Next select the region of text you want to copy out and hit enter.

  At this point the text should be on the clipboard. Now in an email or a document you can paste the contents using the normal keyboard shortcut "CTRL+V" or by clicking "Edit → Paste".

  I usually modify the command window to have a buffer with a height of 9999. This way you can scroll up further.

3. *Q:* After running the Reaper for about 30 minutes, I exited the Reaper and found that a log file was there but it had zero bytes (and clicking on it showed it to be empty). Is it OK if I just give you a copy paste of the last few lines?

  <b>A:</b> I'd prefer it at all possible to have the entire log over a cut and paste. As a quick test, grab and unzip the [http://code.google.com/p/footnotereap/downloads/list latest build]. After it's done inflating run FootnoteReapDbg. Once the application has run for a second or two quit out of the program. Then check in the log folder. The name should look something like Sun 02-12-2012_13.01.21.76_footnotereap_log. If the log is non-zero everything is working. However if this doesn't work please search [http://code.google.com/p/footnotereap/issues/list issues].
