== Milestone Goals ==

The major tasks and [todo]s I want to complete for the next milestone (v0.1.0) are:

*16.* Add a routine to navigate through the local footnote.com folder to double check the IDs to see if additional naming information can be found to validate the current folders (create a new Commandsâ†’Tools category). (external tool)

*7.* Automatically generate PDFs and OCR (external tool)

In addition to 16 it would be nice to have a way to send a request to the reaper to auto-startup and grab or at least test for missing content and then exit. This would require reworking the preamble of fr so it skips all the user input.
